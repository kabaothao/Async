/* 
 *
 * Synchroonous Program Execution

 In a synchronous program execution model,

program is executed line by line, one at a time.

When a function is called,

programming execution has to wait until

the function returns before it continues execution to the next line.


* When a function is called, program execution continues to th enext line, without waiting for the function to complete.
* Asynchronous programming model improves responsiveness of your application.
